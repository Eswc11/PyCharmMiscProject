The program has two classes: Loan and LoanCalculator. The Loan class is a service class and is responsible for all loan calculations. 
One Loan object represents a single loan and receives the loan amount, annual interest rate, and term in years. Since I didn't know the calculation formulas, I had to ask a smart friend for the formula. 
Based on this data, the class provides methods for calculating the monthly payment and the total payment for the entire period. 
The LoanCalculator class acts as a controller and has four methods. It interacts with the user: it requests input data, creates a Loan object, calls its methods, and then displays the results. 
LoanCalculator itself doesn't perform the calculations; it only manages the program's operation.
This ensures a separation of concerns: Loan calculates, and LoanCalculator manages the input and output.
